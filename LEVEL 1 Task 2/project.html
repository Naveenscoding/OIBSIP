		<h3>Mini Project<br>REAL TIME AI VIRTUAL MOUSE USING OPENCV</h3>
		<p>Description: Artificial Intelligence based mini project on “REAL TIME AI VIRTUAL MOUSE USING OPENCV”:
REAL TIME AI VIRTUAL MOUSE USING OPEN CV is a artificial intelligence based project. The proposed system would make use of AI based hand gesture detection with the help of Open CV and python to perform the functions of peripheral devices like mouse and keyboard. The proposed system initially captures the hand gesture through the web camera and recognizes the gesture. Then it performs the function which is assigned to that particular gesture like movement of cursor, selecting a file. </p>

                <h3>IBM Project<br>WEB PHISHING DETECTION</h3>
                <p>Description: Web based project on “WEB PHISHING DETECTION”:
Web Phishing Detection is a web based project. The proposed system would detect whether a particular website is phishing or genuine using the machine learning algorithm. The project is done using python programming language, machine learning algorithm (Decision Tree Algorithm), HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The user would have to specify the URL of the website which they suspects to be as phishing in the proposed system. Then the system would check whether the specified website’s URL is genuine or phishing based on certain criteria that is trained with the machine learning algorithm. After the detection, the system will return the user whether the website is genuine or phishing.</p>
